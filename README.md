# Machine-Learning-Digital-Book-

This notebook is made to understand the Machine learning concepts from the basic level. 

The Digital Book contains the folder simple Linear Regression which has a notebook *Simple Linear Regression.ipynb* that describes **simple Linear Regression** from scratch along with theory and Python code.

The Digital Book contains the folder Logistic Regression which has notebook *Logistic Regression or Classification.ipynb* which explains **Logistic Regression** from scratch along with theory and Python code.

The Digital Book contains the folder Linear Regression With Multiple Variables that have notebook *Linear Regression With Multiple Variable .ipynb* which explains **Linear Regression With Multiple Variable** from scratch along with theory and Python code.

The Digital Book contains the folder Polynomial Regression that has a notebook *Polynomial Regression.ipynb* which explains the important and basic concept of the **Polynomial Regression** along with theory and the python code.

The Digital Book contains the folder Probability Theory 1 which has notebook *Probability Theory 1.ipynb* which explains basic concepts of the **Probability Theory Required For Machine learning** along with python code.

The Digital Book contains the folder Probability Theory 2 which has notebook *Probability Theory 2.ipynb* which is continuation *Probability Theory 1* explains basic concepts of the **Probability Theory Required For Machine learning** along with python code.More emphasis on Gaussian Distribution.

The Book contains the folder Naive Bayes Classification which has notebook *Naive Bayes Classification.ipynb* where I tried my best to explain the intuition behind the **Naive Bayes algorithm** and lastly use some data-set(given in reference) taken from Kaggle to implement the algorithm. Even you will get initial glims of **Natural language processing (NLP)** while going through the text classification module in this chapter.      

This book has folder Prerequisites for SVM which has notebook *Prerequisites for SVM-Support Vector Machine .ipynb* where  chapter we will try to clear some fundamental idea how the machine learning problem is evolved by diving deep into mathematics but not that deep,but yes up to the level where we get the intuition.**While going through the theory of this we touch at last the VC-dimension and Perceptron learning related to SVM and its limitation.**Definitely in the chapter on neural network we will learn more about the Perceptron.
